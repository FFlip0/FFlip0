# configs

This includes configs for 
- WezTerm (\.wezterm.lua)
- GlazeWM with Zebar (\.glzr\)

I'm not sure why you would want to use my configs but if you do then you have to actually download WezTerm and GlazeWM (which comes pre-installed with Zebar) before copy pasting the config because the configs arent the programs them self
